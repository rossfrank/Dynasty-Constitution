## __Section I - League Governance__ ##

### League Commissioner ###
__Ross Frank__

### Commissioner Site Powers ###
The commissioner has the ability to (in appropriate situations) edit lineups (either current or past), add/drop players, push/undo trades, and edit game scores. Additionally the commissioner can pause/resume the draft and set/remove draft picks for teams.
### Dispute Arbitration ###
The commissioner is the final authority on all league matters, excluding disputes with a clear conflict of interest. In situations where a league vote is put forth and the outcome is a tie the commissioner will always have the tie-breaking vote. When an issue arises where a clear conflict of interest is apparent the matter will be put to a league vote (the vote will exclude anyone with a conflict of interest).
### Rule Changes ###
In order to change an existing rule, add a new rule, or change a scoring setting, a vote must be called and receive eight votes.
Voting for rule changes can only happen at the Winter meeting, the Draft.
The commissioner reserves the right to hold a vote for a temporary rule change outside of these meetings but they only apply until the next meeting
