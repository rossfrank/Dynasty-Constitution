## __Section I - League Governance__ ##

### Commissioner Powers ###
- The commissioner has the ability to (in appropriate situations) edit lineups (either current or past), add/drop players, push/undo trades, and edit game scores. Additionally, the commissioner can pause/resume the draft and set/remove draft picks for teams.
- The commissioner will enforce the good faith rule as a catch-all rule to maintain the integrity of the league

### Dispute Arbitration ###
- The commissioner is the final authority on all league matters, excluding disputes with a clear conflict of interest. In situations where a league vote is put forth and the outcome is a tie, the commissioner will always have the tie-breaking vote. When an issue arises with a clear conflict of interest, the matter will be put to a league vote (the vote will exclude anyone with a conflict of interest).

### Rule Changes ###
- In order to change an existing rule, add a new rule, or change a scoring setting, a vote must be called and receive seven votes.
- Voting for rule changes can only happen at the Winter or Draft meetings.
- The commissioner reserves the right to update any rules during the season as problems arise that will only apply until the next meeting
- The commissioner will look to the league for advice on temporary rule changes during the season but has final discretion

### Constitution Maintenance ###
- Matt, Ross, and Thomas will maintain the constitution in this repository.
