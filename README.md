## __Section I - League Governance__ ##

### Commissioner Powers ###
- The commissioner has the ability to (in appropriate situations) edit lineups (either current or past), add/drop players, push/undo trades, and edit game scores. Additionally the commissioner can pause/resume the draft and set/remove draft picks for teams.
- The commissioner will enforce the good faith rule as a catch all rule to maintain the integrity of the league

### Dispute Arbitration ###
- The commissioner is the final authority on all league matters, excluding disputes with a clear conflict of interest. In situations where a league vote is put forth and the outcome is a tie the commissioner will always have the tie-breaking vote. When an issue arises where a clear conflict of interest is apparent the matter will be put to a league vote (the vote will exclude anyone with a conflict of interest).

### Rule Changes ###
- In order to change an existing rule, add a new rule, or change a scoring setting, a vote must be called and receive seven votes.
- Voting for rule changes can only happen at the Winter meeting or the Draft.
